// MatchingService.swift
// Written by Claude Code on 2025-11-03
// Refactored for 3NF normalized schema
//
// PURPOSE: Business logic for matching actions to goals
// PATTERN: Pure functions (no side effects, fully testable without database)
//
// KEY CHANGES FROM v1.0:
// - Works with [MeasuredAction] instead of JSON measuresByUnit
// - Works with [ExpectationMeasure] instead of single measurementUnit
// - Metric overlap calculation instead of string matching
//

import Foundation
import Models

/// Stateless matching functions for action-goal relationships (3NF normalized)
///
/// **Architecture Decision**: Why pure functions?
/// - Testable without database
/// - No side effects (predictable, composable)
/// - Clear inputs/outputs (explicit dependencies)
/// - Reusable across UI and backend
///
/// **Usage**:
/// ```swift
/// // 1. Fetch action with measurements
/// let actionDetails = try await ActionsQuery.fetch(db).first { $0.action.id == actionId }
///
/// // 2. Fetch goal with targets
/// let goalDetails = try await GoalsQuery.fetch(db).first { $0.goal.id == goalId }
///
/// // 3. Check match
/// let match = MatchingService.matches(
///     action: actionDetails.action,
///     actionMeasures: actionDetails.measurements.map { ($0.measure, $0.measuredAction.value) },
///     goal: goalDetails.goal,
///     goalTargets: goalDetails.metricTargets.map { ($0.measure, $0.expectationMeasure.targetValue) }
/// )
///
/// if match.isMatch {
///     print("Action contributes \(match.metricMatch.contribution!) to goal")
/// }
/// ```

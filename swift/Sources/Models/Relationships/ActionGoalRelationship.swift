// ActionGoalRelationship.swift
// Represents a derived relationship between an action and a goal

// Written by Claude Code on 2025-10-22
// Ported from Python implementation (python/categoriae/relationships.py)

// This defines WHAT the relationship looks like (the data shape).
// The HOW (matching logic, inference rules) lives in BusinessLogic/MatchingService.swift

/// Represents a discovered or assigned relationship between an action and a goal
///
/// ActionGoalRelationships are DERIVED entities - they represent computed or inferred
/// connections between actions and goals. They can be:
/// - Auto-inferred by matching algorithms (period + unit + description matching)
/// - User-confirmed (user approved an auto-inferred suggestion)
/// - Manual (user explicitly created the relationship)
///
/// **Relationship to Database:**
/// - Stored in `action_goal_progress` table
/// - Acts as a cache/projection - can be recalculated from actions + goals
/// - Has a unique constraint on (action_id, goal_id) - one action can only contribute
///   to a specific goal once
///
/// **Usage Example:**
/// ```swift
/// let relationship = ActionGoalRelationship(
///     actionId: runAction.id,
///     goalId: marathonGoal.id,
///     contribution: 5.0,  // 5 km contributed
///     matchMethod: .autoInferred,
///     confidence: 0.95,
///     matchedOn: [.period, .unit, .description]
/// )
/// ```

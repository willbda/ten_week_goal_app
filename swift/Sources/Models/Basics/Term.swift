// Updated by Claude Code on 2025-10-19 (fixed protocols, moved methods to extensions)
// Updated by Claude Code on 2025-10-31 (refactored to reference TimePeriod via FK)
// Ported from Python implementation (python/categoriae/terms.py)
//
// Inspired by "4,000 Weeks" thinking - how do we structure finite time?
// GoalTerms provide planning scaffolds with state (active, delayed, completed).
// They reference TimePeriods for chronological boundaries.

// MARK: - GoalTerm Struct

/// A goal planning scaffold with temporal boundaries and state
///
/// **Database Table**: `goalTerms`
/// **FK**: `timePeriodId` â†’ `timePeriods.id`
///
/// **Purpose**: Planning container for goals with state and reflection.
///
/// Unlike pure TimePeriods (chronological facts), GoalTerms have:
/// - Planning state (active, delayed, completed)
/// - Theme and focus area
/// - Reflection after completion
/// - Association with goals (via termGoalAssignments)
///
/// **Architecture**:
/// - TimePeriod stores chronological boundaries (start/end dates)
/// - GoalTerm stores planning semantics (theme, status, reflection)
/// - This separation allows calendar periods to exist without goal planning
///
/// **Example**:
/// ```swift
/// // First create the temporal boundary
/// let period = TimePeriod.tenWeeks(
///     from: Date("2025-03-01"),
///     title: "Term 5 Period"
/// )
///
/// // Then create the goal term with planning semantics
/// let term = GoalTerm(
///     timePeriodId: period.id,
///     termNumber: 5,
///     theme: "Health and momentum",
///     status: .active
/// )
/// ```

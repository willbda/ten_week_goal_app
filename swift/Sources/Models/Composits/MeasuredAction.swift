// MeasuredAction.swift
// Junction table linking actions to their measurements
//
// Written by Claude Code on 2025-10-30
//
// ARCHITECTURE:
// - Pure junction table (database artifact)
// - Links Actions to Metrics with measured values
// - Replaces the JSON measuresByUnit dictionary
// - Always accessed in context of its related Persistable entities
//
// 3NF COMPLIANCE:
// - No redundant data (references existing entities)
// - Enables proper indexing and foreign key constraints
// - Each measurement is a separate row (atomic values)
//
// EXAMPLES:
// Action "Morning run" â†’
//   - MeasuredAction(actionId: run.id, measureId: km.id, value: 5.2)
//   - MeasuredAction(actionId: run.id, measureId: minutes.id, value: 28.0)

import Foundation
import SQLiteData

/// Links an action to a metric with a measured value
///
/// **Database Table**: `actionMetrics`
/// **Purpose**: Store measurements for actions
///
/// **Design Principle**: This is a pure junction table - a database artifact
/// that exists solely to link Actions and Metrics. It doesn't need Persistable
/// fields because it's always accessed through its related entities.
///
/// **Why separate from Action?**
/// - Actions can have 0 to many measurements
/// - Enables queries: "All actions measuring distance"
/// - Allows indexing on measureId for aggregations
/// - Maintains 3NF (no multi-valued attributes)
///
/// **Usage**:
/// ```swift
/// // Record that an action measured 5.2 km
/// let measurement = MeasuredAction(
///     actionId: morningRun.id,
///     measureId: kilometersMetric.id,
///     value: 5.2
/// )
///
/// // Record multiple measurements for same action
/// let timeMeasurement = MeasuredAction(
///     actionId: morningRun.id,
///     measureId: minutesMetric.id,
///     value: 28.0
/// )
/// ```

## Table Usage Analysis

### WELL-USED Tables (Historical Data)

#### Abstractions Layer

personalvalues:   13 records  ‚ñà‚ñà ACTIVE
timeperiods:       3 records  ‚ñà LOW (historical terms only)
```

#### Basics Layer
```
goals:                 16 records  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ACTIVE
expectationmeasures:   16 records  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ACTIVE
goalterms:              3 records  ‚ñà LOW (historical terms only)
```

#### Composits Layer
```
measuredactions:    381 records  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ACTIVE
goalrelevances:      32 records  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ACTIVE
```

### UNDERUSED Tables (Future-Ready)

These tables exist for the new architecture but have no historical data:

#### 1. `milestones` (0 records)
**Purpose**: Point-in-time checkpoints
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW FEATURE - No historical equivalent
**Usage**: Will be populated when you create future milestones
**Example**: "Reach 50km by week 5"

#### 2. `obligations` (0 records)
**Purpose**: External commitments with deadlines
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW FEATURE - No historical equivalent
**Usage**: Will be populated when tracking external commitments
**Example**: "Submit quarterly report by Friday"

#### 3. `termgoalassignments` (0 records)
**Purpose**: Link goals to planning terms
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è EMPTY IN OLD DB - Old schema had this table but 0 records
**Usage**: Will be populated when assigning goals to terms
**Recommendation**: Could reconstruct by matching goal dates to term dates

#### 4. `actiongoalcontributions` (0 records)
**Purpose**: Track which actions contributed to which goals
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW FEATURE - No historical equivalent
**Usage**: Will be populated when linking actions to goals for progress tracking
**Recommendation**: Could reconstruct by matching action measurements to goal targets

## Underused Table Assessment

### Should These Tables Be Removed? NO

**Reason**: These are **architectural investments** for the future system, not wasted effort.

#### Keep `milestones` & `obligations`
- Part of the Expectation inheritance pattern
- Enables future feature expansion
- Zero maintenance cost (no data)
- Provides richer goal tracking when needed

#### Keep `termgoalassignments`
- Critical for term planning workflow
- Old DB had 0 records (feature never used)
- Will be essential when you start planning terms
- Can be populated retroactively if desired

#### Keep `actiongoalcontributions`
- Enables progress tracking (key feature!)
- Can be populated via inference:
  ```sql
  -- Example: Auto-link km actions to km goals
  INSERT INTO actiongoalcontributions (actionId, goalId, contributionAmount, measureId)
  SELECT ma.actionId, em.expectationId, ma.value, ma.measureId
  FROM measuredactions ma
  JOIN expectationmeasures em ON ma.measureId = em.measureId
  WHERE ma.value > 0;
  ```

---

## Reconstruction Opportunities

### 1. TermGoalAssignments (Can Infer)
**Logic**: Match goal dates to term dates

```sql
INSERT INTO termgoalassignments (termId, goalId, createdAt)
SELECT
    gt.id,
    g.id,
    datetime('now')
FROM goals g
JOIN expectations e ON g.expectationId = e.id
JOIN goalterms gt
JOIN timeperiods tp ON gt.timePeriodId = tp.id
WHERE g.startDate BETWEEN tp.startDate AND tp.endDate;
```

**Potential**: 16 goals √ó ~1-2 terms each = ~20-30 records

### 2. ActionGoalContributions (Can Infer)
**Logic**: Link actions to goals via matching metrics

```sql
INSERT INTO actiongoalcontributions (actionId, goalId, contributionAmount, measureId)
SELECT
    ma.actionId,
    g.id,
    ma.value,
    ma.measureId
FROM measuredactions ma
JOIN expectationmeasures em ON ma.measureId = em.measureId
JOIN goals g ON em.expectationId = g.expectationId
WHERE ma.value > 0
  AND (
    -- Only link if action occurred during goal period
    (SELECT logTime FROM actions WHERE id = ma.actionId)
    BETWEEN g.startDate AND COALESCE(g.targetDate, '9999-12-31')
  );
```

**Potential**: 381 actions √ó ~1-2 goals each = ~400-600 records

## Missing Data Analysis

### Data We HAD in Old Schema ‚úì
| Field | Old Location | New Location | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Action title/dates | `actions` | `actions` | ‚úÖ Migrated |
| Action measurements | `measuresByUnit` JSON | `measuredactions` | ‚úÖ Parsed |
| Goal title/dates | `goals` | `expectations` + `goals` | ‚úÖ Split |
| Goal targets | `measurementUnit/Target` | `expectationmeasures` | ‚úÖ Normalized |
| Goal relevance | `howGoalIsRelevant` JSON | `goalrelevances` | ‚úÖ Parsed |
| Goal action plan | `howGoalIsActionable` JSON | `goals.actionPlan` | ‚úÖ Extracted |
| Term dates | `goalTerms` | `timeperiods` + `goalterms` | ‚úÖ Split |
| Values | 4 tables | `personalvalues` | ‚úÖ Unified |

### Data We DIDN'T Have (Future Features)
| Feature | Table | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Milestones | `milestones` | NEW - Will populate in future |
| Obligations | `obligations` | NEW - Will populate in future |
| Term-Goal links | `termgoalassignments` | EXISTED but empty (0 records) |
| Action-Goal links | `actiongoalcontributions` | NEW - Can infer retroactively |

---

## Conclusions

### ‚úÖ Data Completeness: 100%
**NO MISSING DATA** from historical database.

Every field from the old schema has been:
1. Migrated directly (basic fields)
2. Parsed and normalized (JSON fields)
3. Split appropriately (table inheritance)
4. Unified (4 value tables ‚Üí 1)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Underused Tables: 4 (Expected)
These tables are **architectural investments**, not waste:
- 2 new entity types (`milestones`, `obligations`)
- 2 relationship types (`termgoalassignments`, `actiongoalcontributions`)

All are **intentional design choices** for the new system.

### üí° Opportunities
Two underused tables CAN be populated retroactively with simple SQL inference:
1. `termgoalassignments` - Match goal dates to term dates (~20-30 records)
2. `actiongoalcontributions` - Link actions to goals via metrics (~400-600 records)

**Recommendation**: Populate these if you want historical progress tracking. Otherwise, they'll naturally populate as you use the new system.

## Recommendations

### Short Term: Keep Everything
‚úÖ All tables serve a purpose
‚úÖ Zero maintenance cost for empty tables
‚úÖ Future-ready architecture

### Optional: Populate Inferred Relationships
If you want to see **historical goal progress**:
1. Run term-goal assignment inference query
2. Run action-goal contribution inference query
3. Verify results look reasonable
4. This enables "which actions helped achieve which goals" analysis

### Long Term: Monitor Usage
After 3-6 months of using the new system, review:
- Are `milestones` and `obligations` being used?
- If not, consider whether they're truly needed
- But given zero cost, likely keep them anyway

---

**Final Verdict**:
- ‚úÖ **Data completeness: 100%**
- ‚úÖ **All entities sufficient for historical data**
- ‚úÖ **Underused tables are intentional, future-ready design**
- üí° **Opportunity to enrich with inferred relationships**

No changes needed. The schema is exactly right for your data.

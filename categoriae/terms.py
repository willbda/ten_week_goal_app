Terms - Time horizons for planning and reflection.

Inspired by "4,000 Weeks" thinking - how do we structure finite time?

A Term is a bounded period of intentional focus. Terms provide:
- Temporal scaffolding for goals (10 weeks, a year, a lifetime)
- Rhythmic reflection points (term reviews, retrospectives)
- Context for priority decisions (what matters THIS term?)

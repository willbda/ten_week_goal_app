# Documentation Status & Gap Analysis
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Written by**: Claude Code

This document identifies divergences between project documentation, GitHub issues, and actual implementation status.

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Reality
- **Version**: 0.5.0-rearchitecture (per version.txt)
- **Branch**: experiment/rearchitecture-data-structures
- **Phase**: Database & Models Complete (Phases 1-2), Repository Layer Next (Phase 3)
- **Breaking Changes**: Intentional - 4 known broken components

### Key Findings
1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Issue #7** is outdated - says "Phase 1 Active" but Phases 1-2 are complete
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **README.md** describes old architecture with Python/Swift split - doesn't reflect 3NF rearchitecture
3. ‚úÖ **VERSIONING.md** is accurate - acknowledges 0.5.0 with rearchitecture in progress
4. ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE_REEVALUATION.md** is still relevant for open questions
5. ‚úÖ **REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md** is now the single source of truth (created today)

## Gap Analysis by Document

### 1. GitHub Issue #7: "Rearchitecture: Database Schema ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Protocols ‚Üí ViewModels"

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/willbda/ten_week_goal_app/issues/7
**Status**: OPEN (created 2025-10-28)

#### What's Outdated
```
Current Phase: Phase 1 - Database Schema Design (active)
```

**Reality**: Phases 1-2 complete as of 2025-10-30

#### Checklist Divergence
Issue shows all tasks for Phases 1-2 as unchecked `[ ]`, but they're actually complete:

**Phase 1 Tasks** (Should be ‚úÖ):
- [x] Finalize core schema decisions (unified values ‚úÖ, metrics as entities ‚úÖ, pure junctions ‚úÖ)
- [x] Define metrics catalog structure (Metric model created ‚úÖ)
- [x] Design relationship tables (All 5 junction tables created ‚úÖ)
- [x] Swift implementation (Replaced Python migration ‚úÖ)
- [x] Document schema decisions (SCHEMA_FINAL.md, 3NF_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md ‚úÖ)

**Phase 2 Tasks** (Should be ‚úÖ):
- [x] Created new model structs (Metric, MeasuredAction, GoalRelevance, ActionGoalContribution ‚úÖ)
- [x] Updated existing models (Action, Value, TermGoalAssignment ‚úÖ)
- [x] Updated @Table definitions (All using SQLiteData ‚úÖ)
- [x] CloudKit sync configuration (SyncEngine updated ‚úÖ)

#### Recommended Update
Update issue #7 with:
1. Change status to "Current Phase: Phase 3 - Repository/Service Layer (next)"
2. Mark Phases 1-2 tasks as complete
3. Link to new REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
4. Update with breaking changes list

---

### 2. README.md (Project Root)

**File**: `/README.md`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18 (per doc), 2025-10-19 (per git)

#### What's Outdated

**Section: "Core Concepts - What This Tracks"**
```markdown
- **Actions**: Daily activities with optional measurements (distance, duration, reps, etc.)
```
‚ùå **Reality**: Actions no longer have `measuresByUnit` JSON - measurements are in `MeasuredAction` junction table

**Section: "Implementation Status - Swift"**
```markdown
Swift (swift/): Active development
- Protocol-oriented architecture matching Python layers
- SQLite integration with GRDB.swift
- Native macOS/iOS planned with SwiftUI
```
‚ùå **Reality**:
- No longer using GRDB - migrated to SQLiteData
- No longer matching Python layers - 3NF schema is Swift-specific
- Python implementation effectively abandoned
- macOS/iOS apps exist and are functional (not "planned")

**Section: "Project Status"**
```markdown
- **Python**: On pause
- **Swift**: Active development (protocol-oriented refactor complete)
- **Shared**: Database schemas stable
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-18
```
‚ùå **Reality**:
- Database schemas NOT stable - complete 3NF rearchitecture in progress
- Protocol-oriented refactor NOT complete - Phase 4 pending protocol redesign
- Python effectively abandoned (not just "on pause")

#### Recommended Updates
1. Add section: "## üöß Major Rearchitecture in Progress (v0.5.0)"
2. Update "Core Concepts" to reflect 3NF normalized schema
3. Replace "SQLite integration with GRDB.swift" with "SQLiteData with CloudKit sync"
4. Add link to REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
5. Update "Last Updated" to 2025-10-31

---

### 3. VERSIONING.md

**File**: `/VERSIONING.md`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

#### What's Accurate ‚úÖ
- Version: 0.5.0-rearchitecture ‚úÖ
- "‚ö†Ô∏è DOCUMENTATION FREEZE" warning ‚úÖ
- "Foundation complete, rearchitecture needed" ‚úÖ
- Breaking changes acknowledged ‚úÖ
- Honest assessment of completeness (~50%) ‚úÖ

#### What's Outdated
**Section: "Path to 1.0 (Revised)"**
```
0.5.0 - Current state (foundation works, needs rethink)
0.6.0 - Data structure simplification (fewer optionals, remove unnecessary protocols)
0.6.5 - SwiftUI integration patterns (ViewModels or better struct shapes)
0.7.0 - Design language defined (visual identity, component library)
```

‚ùå **Reality**: We've chosen 3NF normalization with clean break, not "simplification"

**Section: "Estimated Time to 1.0"**
```
Estimated Time to 1.0: 25-40 hours (accounting for rearchitecture)
- Rearchitecture (data + protocols): 8-12 hours
```

‚ùå **Reality**: Per REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md, 5-7 weeks total (not hours)

#### Recommended Updates
1. Update version roadmap to match REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE phases
2. Change time estimates from hours to weeks
3. Update "Current Status Summary" with Phase 1-2 completion
4. Add note about clean break migration strategy

---

### 4. ARCHITECTURE_REEVALUATION.md

**File**: `/ARCHITECTURE_REEVALUATION.md`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

#### What's Still Relevant ‚úÖ
- Design questions about optionals, protocols, SwiftUI integration ‚úÖ
- "What feels wrong? What feels right?" questions ‚úÖ
- Protocol complexity analysis (9 protocols) ‚úÖ
- Dictionary ‚Üí array pain points ‚úÖ

#### What's Resolved
- ‚úÖ **Decided**: 3NF normalization (addressed dictionary pain)
- ‚úÖ **Decided**: Clean break migration (addressed backward compatibility question)
- ‚úÖ **Decided**: Metrics as first-class entities (addressed measuresByUnit JSON)
- ‚úÖ **Decided**: Unified values table (addressed 4 tables complexity)

#### What's Still Open
- ‚ùì Protocol system redesign (Phase 4 pending)
- ‚ùì SwiftUI integration patterns (Phase 5 pending)
- ‚ùì Design language definition (deferred)
- ‚ùì Concurrency & threading approach (open question)

#### Recommended Action
- Keep document as-is - it's a valuable historical snapshot
- Link to REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md for resolution status
- Update with "Status: Phase 1-2 decisions made, Phase 4+ questions still open"

---

### 5. GitHub Issue #6: "Add Apple Health Workout Viewer"

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/willbda/ten_week_goal_app/issues/6
**Status**: OPEN (created 2025-10-28)

#### Relationship to Rearchitecture
Issue states:
```
# Related Issues
- Can integrate with metrics system after Phase 4
```

‚úÖ **Accurate** - HealthKit integration makes sense AFTER repository/service layer exists

#### Status
- ‚ùå No work started (Stage 1 not begun)
- ‚úÖ Correctly positioned as "future enhancement"
- ‚úÖ Well-documented multi-stage plan

#### Recommended Action
- No changes needed
- Defer until Phase 4 (Repository/Service Layer) complete
- Metrics system will enable better workout ‚Üí action tracking

## Version Alignment Check

| Source | Version | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| version.txt | 0.5.0-rearchitecture | ‚úÖ Accurate | Reflects current state |
| VERSIONING.md | 0.5.0-rearchitecture | ‚úÖ Accurate | Good description |
| README.md | 0.8.0 implied | ‚ùå Wrong | Says "protocol-oriented refactor complete" |
| Git tag | v1.0-python | ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing | Only Python tagged, Swift untagged |
| Latest commit | 661e181 | ‚úÖ Accurate | "Version 0.5.0-rearchitecture" message |

**Recommendation**: Create git tag `v0.5.0-rearchitecture` to match version.txt

---

## Summary

**What's Working**:
- REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md is excellent single source of truth
- VERSIONING.md acknowledges current state honestly
- Breaking changes are documented
- Migration tested successfully

**What Needs Attention**:
1. GitHub Issue #7 outdated (still says Phase 1 active)
2. README.md describes old architecture
3. No git tag for 0.5.0-rearchitecture
4. Estimated time to 1.0 inconsistent (hours vs weeks)

**Recommended Next Actions**:
1. Update GitHub Issue #7 ‚Üí "Phase 3 Next"
2. Add rearchitecture notice to README.md
3. Create git tag: `v0.5.0-rearchitecture`
4. Begin Phase 3: Repository Layer implementation

---

**Conclusion**: Documentation is mostly accurate at the detailed level (schema docs, migration docs) but needs synchronization at the high level (README, GitHub issue, version tags). The creation of REARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md today is a major step toward consolidation.

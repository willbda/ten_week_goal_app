### 📝 Concept Only (Not Designed)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Action-Value relationships** | No domain model, no logic (may be emergent from Action→Goal→Value) |

## Architectural Clarity: Relationships

### Three Distinct Relationship Types

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ACTION → GOAL Relationship                    │
│  - Status: MATURE                              │
│  - Inference: progress_matching.py (ethica)    │
│  - Storage: ActionGoalProgressStorageService   │
│  - Table: action_goal_progress                 │
│  - Use case: "Does this action contribute?"    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GOAL → VALUE Relationship                     │
│  - Status: PARTIAL                             │
│  - Inference: MISSING (needs value_alignment.py)│
│  - Storage: MISSING                            │
│  - Table: MISSING                              │
│  - Use case: "Does this goal serve my values?" │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ACTION → VALUE Relationship                   │
│  - Status: CONCEPT ONLY                        │
│  - Inference: UNDEFINED                        │
│  - Design question: Emergent from Action→Goal→Value?│
│  - Use case: "Am I living my values?"          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Distinction: Inference vs Assignment

**Inference** (Computing suggested relationships):
- Layer: **ethica/** (business logic)
- Process: Algorithm analyzes entities and suggests matches
- Output: `List[DerivedRelationship]` with confidence scores
- State: Transient (can be recalculated anytime)
- Examples: `infer_matches()`, `infer_value_alignment()` (future)

**Assignment** (Managing confirmed relationships):
- Layer: **rhetorica/politica** (storage)
- Process: User reviews inference suggestions and confirms/rejects
- Output: Persistent relationships with `assignment_method` field
- State: Durable (stored in database)
- Methods:
  - `auto_inferred` → Algorithm suggested
  - `user_confirmed` → User approved suggestion
  - `manual` → User explicitly created

**Review UI** bridges inference and assignment:
1. Run inference → Get suggestions
2. Present to user → Review interface
3. User confirms/rejects → Store assignments
4. Stored assignments supersede future inference

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Values Foundation (Expose What Exists)

**Goal:** Enable value-aware planning by exposing fully mature values system

**Rationale:**
- Domain entities complete and tested (16 tests)
- Storage service works with polymorphic types
- Critical for your use case: "consider actions/goals in context of values"

**Tasks:**

#### 1.1 CLI Interface
```bash
# Value management commands
cli.py values list                          # List all values
cli.py values list --type major            # Filter by type
cli.py values list --area Health           # Filter by life area
cli.py values show --id 5                  # Detail view
cli.py values create --name "Health" \
              --description "..." \
              --type major \
              --area Health \
              --priority 10
cli.py values edit --id 5 --priority 5
cli.py values delete --id 5
```

**Files to create:**
- `interfaces/cli.py` - Add `values` subcommand
- Update formatters for value display

#### 1.2 Web Interface
```
/values                  # Values dashboard
/values/<id>            # Value detail view
/value/new              # Create form
/value/<id>/edit        # Edit form
```

**Files to create:**
- `interfaces/web_app.py` - Add routes
- `interfaces/templates/values.html`
- `interfaces/templates/value_detail.html`
- `interfaces/templates/value_form.html`

#### 1.3 API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/values              # List with filters
GET  /api/values/<id>         # Detail
POST /api/values              # Create
PUT  /api/values/<id>         # Update
DELETE /api/values/<id>       # Delete
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Can list all values with hierarchy types
- [ ] Can filter by life area and priority
- [ ] Can create/edit/delete values through all interfaces
- [ ] Polymorphic storage works (MajorValue retrieves as MajorValue)

---

### Phase 2: Action Management (Build Missing Layers)

**Goal:** Enable daily action tracking with validation and interfaces

**Current State:**
- ✅ categoriae: `Action` class complete
- ✅ politica: CRUD operations exist
- ✅ rhetorica: `ActionStorageService` exists
- ❌ ethica: No validation rules defined
- ❌ interfaces: No CRUD operations

**Build Order:**

#### 2.1 Business Logic Layer (ethica)

Create `ethica/action_validation.py`:
```python
"""
Action validation rules - what makes a valid action?

Business rules:
- Description required and non-empty
- Measurements must be positive numbers
- If start_time provided, duration_minutes required
- log_time cannot be in future
- Measurement keys must be valid units
"""

def validate_action(action: Action) -> ValidationResult:
    """Validate action against business rules."""

def validate_measurement_keys(measurements: dict) -> bool:
    """Check measurement keys are recognized units."""

def suggest_measurement_keys(description: str) -> List[str]:
    """Suggest measurement keys based on description."""
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents invalid data entry
- Enforces business rules consistently
- Provides helpful feedback to user

#### 2.2 Storage Conveniences (rhetorica)

`ActionStorageService` exists but could add:
```python
def get_by_date_range(start: date, end: date) -> List[Action]:
    """Fetch actions in date range."""

def get_by_measurement_type(unit: str) -> List[Action]:
    """Fetch actions with specific measurement type."""

def search_descriptions(query: str) -> List[Action]:
    """Full-text search on descriptions."""
```

#### 2.3 Interfaces (CLI + Web + API)

**CLI:**
```bash
cli.py action add "Ran 5km" --km 5.0 --date 2025-10-12
cli.py action list --from 2025-10-01 --to 2025-10-31
cli.py action list --unit km
cli.py action edit 123 --description "Ran 5.5km" --km 5.5
cli.py action delete 123
cli.py action search "yoga"
```

**Web:**
```
/actions                      # List with filters
/action/new                   # Create form
/action/<id>/edit             # Edit form
/action/<id>/delete           # Delete confirmation
```

**API:**
```
GET  /api/actions?from=...&to=...&unit=...
POST /api/actions
PUT  /api/actions/<id>
DELETE /api/actions/<id>
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Validation rules prevent invalid actions
- [ ] Can create actions through all interfaces
- [ ] Can filter/search actions effectively
- [ ] Can edit/delete actions safely

---

### Phase 3: Values Implementation (Your Personal Values)

**Goal:** Populate system with your actual values using interfaces from Phase 1

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 1 complete (values interfaces working)

**Tasks:**

#### 3.1 Define Your Values Hierarchy

Document in `.documentation/personal_values.md`:
```markdown
# My Personal Values

## Highest Order Values (Ultimate purposes)
1. **Growth & Development** (Priority: 1)
   - Life area: Personal Development
   - Why: Continuous improvement is fulfillment

## Major Values (Important life domains)
1. **Health & Vitality** (Priority: 5)
   - Life area: Health
   - Serves: Growth & Development

2. **Meaningful Work** (Priority: 8)
   - Life area: Career
   - Serves: Growth & Development

## Values (Specific motivators)
...
```

#### 3.2 Enter Values Through UI

Use Phase 1 web interface or CLI to enter:
- Highest order values (~2-3)
- Major values (~5-8)
- Regular values (~10-15)

#### 3.3 Verify Storage

Test polymorphic retrieval:
```python
values_service = ValuesStorageService()
all_values = values_service.get_all()

# Should retrieve correct types
for v in all_values:
    assert type(v).__name__ == v.type_name  # Polymorphism working
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Personal values documented
- [ ] Values entered through UI
- [ ] Polymorphic storage verified
- [ ] Can view values in all interfaces

---

### Phase 4: Relationship Management Architecture

**Goal:** Clarify and implement relationship lifecycle systematically

#### 4.1 Architectural Clarification

**The Relationship Lifecycle:**
```
1. INFERENCE (ethica)
   ↓ Algorithm suggests relationships

2. REVIEW (interfaces)
   ↓ User sees suggestions

3. ASSIGNMENT (rhetorica/politica)
   ↓ User confirms/rejects

4. STORAGE (politica)
   ↓ Confirmed relationships persist

5. USAGE (all layers)
   ↓ Stored relationships used in analysis
```

#### 4.2 Action-Goal Relationships (Already Mature)

**What exists:**
- ✅ Inference: `ethica/progress_matching.py` with how_goal_is_actionable
- ✅ Storage: `rhetorica/progress_storage.py`
- ✅ Table: `action_goal_progress`
- ✅ Tests: `test_how_goal_is_actionable_matching.py`

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Review UI for ambiguous matches
- ❌ Manual match creation UI
- ❌ Confirmation workflow

**Build:**

Create `interfaces/cli.py` additions:
```bash
# Review inference suggestions
cli.py inference run --from 2025-04-01 --to 2025-06-21
cli.py inference review              # Show pending suggestions
cli.py inference show --match-id 45  # Detail view
cli.py inference confirm 45          # Accept suggestion
cli.py inference reject 46           # Reject suggestion

# Manual relationship management
cli.py match create --action 123 --goal 5 --contribution 5.0
cli.py match list --goal 5
cli.py match delete --action 123 --goal 5
```

Web interface:
```
/inference/review                    # Review dashboard
/inference/match/<id>               # Detail + confirm/reject
/goal/<id>/matches                  # Manage matches for goal
```

#### 4.3 Goal-Value Alignment (Needs Building)

**Current state:**
- ✅ Domain: `GoalValueAlignment` class exists
- ❌ Inference: No `ethica/value_alignment.py`
- ❌ Storage: No service or table
- ❌ Tests: None

**Build Order:**

**Step 1: Design inference logic**

Create `ethica/value_alignment.py`:
```python
"""
Goal-Value alignment inference.

Detects which goals serve which values based on:
- Life area matching (goal.life_area == value.life_area)
- Keyword overlap (goal description contains value keywords)
- Explicit alignment_guidance in value
"""

def infer_value_alignments(
    goals: List[Goal],
    values: List[MajorValue]
) -> List[GoalValueAlignment]:
    """
    Suggest which goals align with which values.

    Algorithm:
    1. Match by life area (Health goal → Health value)
    2. Check alignment_guidance keywords
    3. Score alignment strength (0.0-1.0)
    4. Return suggestions above threshold
    """
```

**Step 2: Create storage**

Schema `politica/schemas/goal_value_alignment.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE goal_value_alignment (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  goal_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  value_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  alignment_strength REAL NOT NULL,
  assignment_method TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence REAL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  FOREIGN KEY (goal_id) REFERENCES goals(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_id) REFERENCES values(id),
  UNIQUE(goal_id, value_id)
);
```

Service `rhetorica/value_alignment_storage.py`:
```python
class GoalValueAlignmentStorageService:
    """Manage goal-value relationship persistence."""

    def store_alignments(self, alignments: List[GoalValueAlignment])
    def get_by_goal(self, goal_id: int)
    def get_by_value(self, value_id: int)
    def create_manual_alignment(...)
    def confirm_suggestion(...)
```

**Step 3: Build interfaces**

CLI:
```bash
cli.py alignment infer              # Run inference
cli.py alignment review             # Review suggestions
cli.py alignment confirm 78
cli.py goal show --id 5 --with-values  # Show goal's values
cli.py value show --id 3 --with-goals  # Show value's goals
```

Web:
```
/alignment/review                   # Review suggested alignments
/goal/<id>/values                  # Manage goal's values
/value/<id>/goals                  # Manage value's goals
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Can infer goal-value alignments
- [ ] Can review and confirm suggestions
- [ ] Can manually create alignments
- [ ] Can view goals by value
- [ ] Can answer: "Which values are my goals serving?"

#### 4.4 Action-Value Relationships (Design Decision Needed)

**Question:** Are Action-Value relationships:
- **Emergent** from Action→Goal→Value chain?
- **Direct** (actions can reflect values without goal)?

**Option A: Emergent (Recommended)**
```python
def get_action_values(action: Action) -> List[Tuple[Value, float]]:
    """
    Get values an action serves (transitively).

    Algorithm:
    1. Find goals this action contributes to
    2. Find values those goals align with
    3. Compute transitive alignment strength
    """
    action_goals = get_action_goals(action)
    values = []
    for goal, contribution in action_goals:
        goal_values = get_goal_values(goal)
        for value, alignment in goal_values:
            strength = contribution * alignment
            values.append((value, strength))
    return aggregate(values)
```

**Benefits:**
- No new relationship type needed
- Reflects actual planning structure (set goals → track actions)
- Simpler to reason about

**Option B: Direct**
- Add `ActionValueReflection` relationship
- Inference logic for direct value expression
- Use case: Actions that reflect values without specific goal

**Decision deferred until Phase 4 implementation**

---

### Phase 5: Terms & Time Horizons

**Goal:** Enable term-based planning and value neglect analysis

**Current State:**
- ✅ categoriae: `TenWeekTerm`, `YearlyPlan`, `LifeTime` complete
- ✅ categoriae: Calculation methods work
- ❌ Storage: No `TermStorageService`
- ❌ Table: No `terms` schema
- ❌ Tests: No `test_terms.py`
- ❌ Integration: Goals not linked to terms

**Build Order:**

#### 5.1 Storage Layer

**Schema** `politica/schemas/terms.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE terms (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  term_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  start_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  end_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  theme TEXT,
  reflection TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  UNIQUE(term_number)
);

-- Link goals to terms
ALTER TABLE goals ADD COLUMN term_id INTEGER REFERENCES terms(id);
```

**Service** `rhetorica/term_storage.py`:
```python
class TermStorageService(StorageService[TenWeekTerm]):
    """Manage term persistence."""

    def get_current_term(self) -> Optional[TenWeekTerm]
    def get_by_year(self, year: int) -> List[TenWeekTerm]
    def get_active_goals(self, term_id: int) -> List[Goal]
```

#### 5.2 Business Logic

**Term Analysis** `ethica/term_analysis.py`:
```python
"""
Term-based analysis - which values were prioritized/neglected?

Answers questions:
- Which values did I focus on this term?
- Which values were neglected?
- How balanced was my term across life areas?
"""

def analyze_term_value_focus(
    term: TenWeekTerm,
    goals: List[Goal],
    values: List[MajorValue],
    alignments: List[GoalValueAlignment]
) -> TermValueReport:
    """
    Analyze which values were emphasized this term.

    Returns:
    - values_served: List[(value, goal_count, action_count)]
    - values_neglected: List[value]
    - balance_score: 0.0-1.0 (how balanced across life areas)
    - recommendations: List[str] for next term
    """
```

#### 5.3 Planning Workflow

**Use case:** "Set goals for next term with awareness of neglected values"

Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Review current term
cli.py term review --current
# Shows: Which values served, which neglected

# 2. Plan next term
cli.py term plan --next
# Suggests: Focus on neglected values

# 3. Create goals
cli.py goal create --term-id 2 --aligned-with "Health" ...

# 4. Start tracking
cli.py action add "Morning run" --km 5.0
```

#### 5.4 Interfaces

CLI:
```bash
cli.py term list
cli.py term current
cli.py term review --id 1               # Analysis + reflection
cli.py term plan --next                 # Planning aid
cli.py term create --start 2025-04-12 --theme "Health & Learning"
```

Web:
```
/terms                          # Term timeline
/term/<id>                      # Term dashboard
/term/<id>/review              # Value analysis
/term/new                       # Planning wizard
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Can create and manage terms
- [ ] Goals link to terms
- [ ] Can analyze value focus per term
- [ ] Can identify neglected values
- [ ] Planning workflow supports value awareness

---

### Phase 6: Goal-Value Alignment Analysis

**Goal:** Answer "Which values have been ignored?" systematically

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 4 complete (Goal-Value alignments work)
- Phase 5 complete (Terms work)

**Capabilities to Build:**

#### 6.1 Value Neglect Detection

`ethica/value_analysis.py`:
```python
def detect_neglected_values(
    values: List[MajorValue],
    alignments: List[GoalValueAlignment],
    progress: List[GoalProgress],
    time_period: Optional[TenWeekTerm] = None
) -> ValueNeglectReport:
    """
    Identify which values lack goal/action support.

    Algorithm:
    1. For each value, count aligned goals
    2. For aligned goals, check progress
    3. Flag values with:
       - No aligned goals
       - Aligned goals with no progress
       - Aligned goals below 25% progress
    4. Weight by value priority
    """
```

#### 6.2 Dashboard Views

**Values Dashboard:**
```
/values/health-check                # Value health overview

For each major value:
├─ Aligned goals: 3
├─ Active goals: 2
├─ Progress: 45% avg
├─ Actions this term: 23
└─ Status: ACTIVE / NEGLECTED / OVEREMPHASIZED
```

**Term Planning:**
```
/term/plan?term=2                  # Next term planning

Values needing attention:
├─ Health (last addressed: 3 terms ago)
├─ Relationships (only 10% progress current term)
└─ Learning (no aligned goals)

Suggested goals:
├─ Health goal: "Exercise 3x/week"
└─ Relationship goal: "Weekly social activities"
```

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Can identify neglected values
- [ ] Can see value health across terms
- [ ] Planning workflow highlights neglected values
- [ ] Can answer: "Am I living according to my values?"

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Skipping ethica Layer

**Wrong:**
```python
# Putting business logic in interface
@app.route('/action/validate')
def validate_action():
    if not action.description:
        return error("Description required")  # Business rule in interface!
```

**Right:**
```python
# Business logic in ethica
from ethica.action_validation import validate_action

@app.route('/action/validate')
def validate_action_endpoint():
    result = validate_action(action)  # ethica handles rules
    return jsonify(result)
```

### ❌ Building UI Before Backend

**Wrong:**
```python
# Building forms before storage works
@app.route('/term/new')
def create_term_form():
    # No TermStorageService exists yet!
    return render_template('term_form.html')
```

**Right:**
1. Build TermStorageService
2. Write tests
3. Verify storage works
4. **Then** build form

### ❌ Conflating Inference and Assignment

**Wrong:**
```python
# Storing inference results directly
matches = infer_matches(actions, goals)
for match in matches:
    db.insert('action_goal_progress', match)  # No review step!
```

**Right:**
```python
# Inference suggests, user confirms, then store
suggestions = infer_matches(actions, goals)  # Transient
reviewed = user_reviews(suggestions)         # UI step
confirmed = filter(reviewed, accepted=True)
storage_service.store_relationships(confirmed)  # Persistent
```

### ❌ Premature Optimization

**Wrong:**
```python
# Building complex caching before it's needed
class CachedInferenceService:
    def infer_with_redis_cache(...)  # Complexity before necessity
```

**Right:**
```python
# Simple first, optimize later
def infer_matches(...):
    # Straightforward implementation
    # Profile first, optimize second
```

- ✅ **Progress Dashboard**: Full reporting with action matching

**CLI Commands Available:**
```bash
# Actions (6 commands)
cli.py action create|list|show|edit|delete|goals

# Goals (6 commands)
cli.py goal create|list|show|edit|delete|progress

# Terms (7 commands)
cli.py term create|list|show|current|edit|add-goal|remove-goal

# Values (5 commands)
cli.py value create|list|show|edit|delete

# Progress (1 command)
cli.py progress [--verbose]
```

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start Using the System** - Enter your data via CLI or API
   - Create actions: Track what you do
   - Create goals: Define what you want to achieve
   - Create terms: Organize goals into 10-week periods
   - Create values: Define what matters (optional for now)

2. **Add Flask API Integration Tests** - Test endpoints with actual HTTP requests

### Future Enhancements (When Needed)

3. **Goal-Value Alignment** - Build inference logic when you want to track value alignment
4. **Frontend Development** - Build web UI consuming Flask API
5. **Enhanced Reporting** - Additional analytics and visualizations

**Architecture Success:** System demonstrates clean separation of concerns. Backend (categoriae → ethica → rhetorica → politica) is solid, Flask API mirrors the simplicity, and CLI provides equivalent functionality with terminal-friendly formatting.

## Phase 1 Completion Notes (2025-10-13)

**What was delivered:**
- Values CLI with type-specific commands (create-major, create-highest-order, etc.)
- ValuesStorageService with polymorphic type support
- ValuesOrchestrationService with result objects pattern
- Entity self-identification via `incentive_type` class attributes
- Comprehensive VALUES_QUICKSTART.md documentation
- 17 tests passing (domain + storage)

**Architectural decisions:**
- Domain validates itself (PriorityLevel constructor)
- Orchestration translates exceptions → result objects
- No separate ethica validation needed for simple domain constraints
- Type-specific CLI commands > generic --type flag

**Ready for Phase 3:** Can now enter personal values using working CLI.

## Flask API Migration Completion Notes (2025-10-14)

**What was delivered:**
- Modular Flask API with Blueprint organization
- RESTful endpoints for Goals, Actions, Values, Terms (4 complete APIs)
- Application factory pattern (flask_main.py)
- Serialization infrastructure (rhetorica/serializers.py)
- Field name standardization (logtime → log_time, name → common_name)
- Clean imports (removed sys.path manipulation from route files)
- 8 new term-action filtering tests (90 total passing)

**Architectural decisions:**
- Entry point scripts handle path setup (flask_main.py, cli.py)
- Route files have clean imports (no sys.path manipulation)
- serialize/deserialize utilities use entity constitutive_parts declarations
- API routes are pure orchestration (delegate to ethica + rhetorica)
- Blueprint organization mirrors domain layer structure

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed Action.logtime → Action.log_time throughout codebase
- Fixed Values.name → Values.common_name in CLI and formatters
- Fixed LifeTime to use datetime instead of date for consistency

**Infrastructure improvements:**
- Removed old monolithic web interface (interfaces/web/)
- Added modular API structure (interfaces/flask/routes/api/)
- Application factory supports testing and multiple configs
- All API endpoints have comprehensive docstrings with examples

**Ready for:** Flask API integration tests, frontend development consuming API.

## ROADMAP Status Audit (2025-10-15)

**What was audited:**
- Comprehensive code inspection across all layers (categoriae, ethica, rhetorica, politica, interfaces)
- Test coverage verification (90 passing tests)
- Flask API endpoint inventory (27 total endpoints across 4 APIs)
- CLI command availability check

**Key findings:**

1. **Backend Layers: Excellent** ✅
   - All domain models complete and tested
   - Business logic comprehensive (progress, matching, term lifecycle)
   - Storage services implement polymorphism correctly
   - Database schemas exist for all entities

2. **Flask API: Production Ready** ✅
   - Actions API: 6 endpoints (CRUD + goal matching)
   - Goals API: 6 endpoints (CRUD + progress calculation)
   - Terms API: 10 endpoints (CRUD + goal assignment + lifecycle)
   - Values API: 5 endpoints (CRUD with type filtering)
   - All endpoints have comprehensive docstrings with examples

3. **CLI Commands: Inconsistent** ⚠️
   - Values: Full CRUD implemented (`create-major`, `create-highest-order`, `list`, `show`, `edit`, `delete`)
   - Progress: Read-only view (`show-progress` with verbose mode)
   - Actions: **Missing** (no CLI commands, API-only)
   - Goals: **Partial** (only show-progress, no CRUD commands)
   - Terms: **Missing** (no CLI commands, API-only)

4. **Corrected Misconceptions:**
   - ROADMAP claimed "Action CRUD needs ethica validation + interfaces" ❌
   - Reality: No separate validation layer exists (domain validates itself) ✅
   - Reality: Flask API interfaces fully implemented ✅
   - Only gap: CLI convenience commands

5. **Architecture Pattern Success:**
   - API-first approach working well
   - Backend layers properly separated and testable
   - CLI becomes optional convenience wrapper (not critical path)
   - Values system demonstrates complete implementation pattern

**Recommended updates applied:**
- ✅ Updated "Current State Assessment" table with accurate Flask API status
- ✅ Added test count column (90 total)
- ✅ Clarified that CLI gaps don't block functionality (API works)
- ✅ Updated "Next Steps" to prioritize API usage over CLI development
- ✅ Noted Goal-Value Alignment is truly the only incomplete feature

**Architecture validation:** The Aristotelian layer separation is working exactly as designed. Backend maturity enabled rapid API development without interface coupling.

## CLI Refactor Completion Notes (2025-10-15)

**What was delivered:**
- Complete CLI matching Flask API architecture (1,287 lines)
- 25 commands covering all CRUD operations
- Action commands: create, list, show, edit, delete, goals (6)
- Goal commands: create, list, show, edit, delete, progress (6)
- Term commands: create, list, show, current, edit, add-goal, remove-goal (7)
- Value commands: create, list, show, edit, delete (5 - consolidated from 4 separate commands)
- Progress dashboard command with verbose mode (1)

**Architecture pattern (matches Flask API):**
```
CLI Args → parse → Entity → StorageService → Database
         ← format ← Entity ← StorageService ←
```

**Key improvements over old CLI:**
- Removed ValuesOrchestrationService layer (uses storage directly)
- Removed result objects pattern (uses try/except like Flask API)
- Consolidated value creation (one `create` command with `--type` flag, not 4 separate commands)
- Direct storage service usage (no intermediate orchestration)
- Consistent error handling across all commands

**Supporting files created:**
- `interfaces/cli/cli.py` - Main CLI with all commands (1,287 lines)
- `interfaces/cli/cli_utils.py` - Argument parsing helpers (181 lines)
- `interfaces/cli/__init__.py` - Package init (8 lines)
- `interfaces/cli/cli_formatters.py` - Terminal formatting (restored by user)

**Testing:**
- All commands tested and working
- Handles missing entities gracefully
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- JSON argument parsing for complex data
- Date/datetime parsing with helpful error messages

**Architecture success:**
- CLI now mirrors Flask API simplicity exactly
- Both interfaces use identical backend layers
- No duplicate logic between CLI and API
- Single source of truth for entity creation (serializers)
- Clean separation: commands (CLI) vs routes (Flask) vs business logic (ethica) vs storage (rhetorica/politica)

**Ready for:** Daily usage tracking actions, goals, and terms. Values commands available for future goal-value alignment work.
